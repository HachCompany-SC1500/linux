    bool "RL78 support"
    ---help---
      This driver implements the request handler for the connected RL78 sub processors.
      Each RL78 handles up to 3 probes which are connected with the sub processor via Modbus.
      Each RL78 uses a seperate request line and a common interrupt (IRQ2) to notify the SH4 master of events.

      If you want RL78 support, you should say Y here.

      This RL78 support can also be built as a module.
