config MMC_UNSAFE_RESUME
	bool "Assume MMC/SD cards are non-removable (DANGEROUS)"
	help
	  If you say Y here, the MMC layer will assume that all cards
	  stayed in their respective slots during the suspend. The
	  normal behaviour is to remove them at suspend and
	  redetecting them at resume. Breaking this assumption will
	  in most cases result in data corruption.

	  This option is usually just for embedded systems which use
	  a MMC/SD card for rootfs. Most people should say N here.

	  This option sets a default which can be overridden by the
	  module parameter "removable=0" or "removable=1".


config MMC_ALLOW_ACCESS_TO_FX
        bool "Allow acces to function 0 0xF0...0xFF registers"
        default n
        help
           Some drivers, e.g. CSR1050, need to access the function 0 registers directly
